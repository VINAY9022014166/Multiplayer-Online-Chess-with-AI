# Multiplayer-Online-Chess-with-AI
Built a Java-based online chess platform with real-time multiplayer over TCP sockets and a client-server, multithreaded architecture. Added an AI opponent using Minimax with alpha-beta pruning, plus move validation, check/checkmate detection, and a clean GUI for smooth play.
