# ♟️ Multiplayer Online Chess with AI (Java)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Java-based online chess platform** that supports:
- Real-time **multiplayer gameplay** over TCP sockets.
- An intelligent **AI opponent** using the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**.
- A clean **graphical user interface (GUI)** for smooth player interaction.

It combines **network programming, artificial intelligence, and object-oriented design** to deliver an interactive chess experience.

## 🛠 Features
- ✅ **Real-Time Multiplayer**: Built with **TCP sockets** and a **client-server architecture**.  
- ✅ **AI Opponent**: Implements **Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning** for efficient decision-making.  
- ✅ **Move Validation**: Ensures legal moves, check, and checkmate detection.  
- ✅ **Multithreading**: Handles multiple clients simultaneously with minimal latency.  
- ✅ **User Interface**: Intuitive **Java Swing/JavaFX** GUI for seamless gameplay.  
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Runs on any OS with Java installed.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Server Setup**  
   - Run the **server application** to host the chess game.  
   - Handles multiple players with **multithreading**.  

2. **Client Connection**  
   - Players connect using the **client application**.  
   - Communicates with server using **TCP sockets**.  

3. **Gameplay**  
   - Players take turns with move validation and rule enforcement.  
   - AI opponent available when playing in single-player mode.  
   - The game detects **check, checkmate, and stalemate** conditions.

## 🔑 Key Algorithms
### Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning
- **Minimax** explores possible future moves for both players.  
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning** reduces unnecessary computations, making the AI faster.  
- Evaluates:
  - Piece values
  - Board control
  - Checkmate conditions
